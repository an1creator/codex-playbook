# Global Rules (universal for any repositories)

## Priorities
1) First follow local repository rules (AGENTS/project instructions).
2) Make minimal sufficient changes.
3) Plan first, then execute.

## Work Discipline
- Don't make up run/check commands: if unsure — mark UNKNOWN and ask.
- Don't modify policy/contract/documentation files automatically without explicit instruction.
- Don't do mass refactoring/formatting "along the way".
- Add code comments only to explain "why" (invariant/workaround/reason), not "what".

## Security
- Destructive actions (deletion/migrations/dangerous commands) — only after explicit user confirmation.
